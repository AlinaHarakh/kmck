[birds chirping]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Dennis Flake: The Kaintucks are boatmen
from the Ohio Valley.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Emily Davie: Generally what we now think of as 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000
Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, those kind of areas.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
Dennis Flake: And they're called "Kaintucks"

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.900
because a large percentage of them are from Kentucky.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.000
So what they do to find a market,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.700
is they build flatboats out of huge logs.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
So these men go down the Ohio River using

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.280
the current, down the Mississippi River to Natchez and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.000
New Orleans.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.900
And the way these men get back home

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.970
to the Ohio Valley, is they walk.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.080
Emily Davie: They would walk back up this trail.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.200
This trail, this Natchez Trace was the way to get back home.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.000
Between Natchez and Nashville, this was the most direct route.

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:23.079
So these Kaintucks had to trudge their way
up this,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.020
basically 500-mile long trail to get home.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.359
Dennis Flake: And by 1810, ten thousand boatmen a year are going up the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:39.300
old Natchez Trace, and these men would have a significant amount of money.
